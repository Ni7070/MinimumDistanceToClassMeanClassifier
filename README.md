# MinimumDistanceToClassMeanClassifier
The minimum distance to class mean classifier is one of the
basic classifiers. This classifier is trained with a sample
data set. Then the mean of each class is derived. From the
test data set the distance of each data from those mean
points are taken. Test data are classified based on the
shortest distance found from any class.

The minimum distance to class mean
classifier works on unclassified data and classifies them
according to their distance from each class. If the
distance is nearer to class1, then it is classified to class2,
if the distance is nearer to class2 then it is classified to
class2. A decision boundary line is drawn to separate
the classes. From the experiment of the given test data,
the accuracy of the found 85.714%.
